<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Centrifugal Industrial Dryer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct</li><li>Indirect</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Centrifugal industrial dryers are categorized into two main types: direct and indirect. In direct dryers, hot air or gas is introduced directly into the material being dried, facilitating rapid moisture removal. This method is efficient for materials that can handle high temperatures. Conversely, indirect dryers use heated surfaces to remove moisture without direct exposure to hot air or gas, making them suitable for heat-sensitive materials. Both types serve diverse industries, optimizing drying processes based on specific material requirements.</p></p>
