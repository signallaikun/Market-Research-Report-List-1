<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Home Lighting Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Off-grid Solar</li><li>Grid-tied Solar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Solar Home Lighting Equipment market features two main types: off-grid solar and grid-tied solar systems. Off-grid solar systems operate independently, utilizing solar panels, batteries, and inverters to provide electricity in remote areas without connection to the electrical grid. In contrast, grid-tied solar systems are connected to the conventional power grid, allowing users to generate electricity from solar panels while remaining linked to the grid for backup power and energy sales during excess generation. Both systems aim to enhance energy access.</p></p>
